# Data-Analysis-HARP-150
Analyzed CitiBike data in New York City from March 2024

This code analyzed CitiBike data to answer 6 different research questions for a final project.
Dataset taken from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data 

Graph 1:
When do people begin riding CitiBikes during the day?
The line graph shows that most people begin their ride around either 8:00AM or 5:00PM.

Graph 2:
Do rides started later in the day have a longer duration?
The stat plot shows no statistical significance that rides started at any time will last longer.

Graph 3:
Do more people ride CitiBike's electric bikes than classic bikes.
The pie chart does show that more people ride the electric bikes. However, electric bikes made up 52.55% of the rides in march which is very close to Classic Bike's 47.45%. So no conclusion can be made based on the data.

Graph 4:
What are the most popular stations for people to pick up and drop off CitiBikes?
The horizontal bar chart of the top ten most popular stations shows that both the Grove St PATH and Hoboken Terminal - River St & Hudson Pl stations are the two most popular by  large margin.

Graph 5:
Are more people that ride CitiBikes part of their membership program?
The pie chart shows that yes, more people who use CitiBikes are already members. This makes sense as it is cheaper for someone who uses CitiBikes regularly to become a member than pay for each ride.

Graph 6:
What is the most popular day to go for a CitiBike ride?
The bar chart shows that Fridays are the most popular. However, every other day of the week has a similar number of rides.
